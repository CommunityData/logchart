# Logchart
Standard semi-log time series chart using D3 

This chart setup uses D3 to render interactive SVG charts. The current index.html file can run the chart without any additional files being loaded. 

# About the examples 
The index.html file uses inline data. Datatest.html loads CSV data. The datatest.html example is also built to allow for multiple datasets to be added to the same chart. Work still needs to be done to change the gridline functions from js to SVG as well as as modify the secondary plotlines to show different symbols. 

# About the standard chart attributes 
The Standard Celeration Chart chart likenesses reproduced in the current D3.js format are intended to reflect the critical attributes of the standard charts first developed by Dr. Ogden R. Lindsley. The number of log-based cycles on the y-axis, amount and distribution of calendar time intervals on the x-axis, number of celeration periods, and aspect ratio are designed to be consistent with the attributes described by Dr. Lindsley. This log chart is a likeness of the Standard Celeration Chart Â© Behavior Research Company (http://www.behaviorresearchcompany.com/).
