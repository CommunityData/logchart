Standard semi-log time series chart using D3 

This chart is a likeness of the Standard Celeration Chart Â© Behavior Research Company (http://www.behaviorresearchcompany.com/). 

The Standard Celeration Chart chart likenesses reproduced in the current D3.js format are intended to reflect the critical attributes of the standard charts first developed by Dr. Ogden R. Lindsley. The number of log-based cycles on the y-axis, amount and distribution of calendar time intervals on the x-axis, number of celeration periods, and aspect ratio are designed to be consistent with the attributes described by Dr. Lindsley. 

Neither Patrick Marcotte nor Chicago Community Data Project should be credited with creation of such measurement standards or the organization of such standards into a graphical display. Replication of such measurement and visualization properties is done solely for the advancement of standardized time series analysis and at no point does Patrick Marcotte or Chicago Community Data Project intend to commercialize, trademark, or obtain copyrights to Standard Celeration Charts. 

This chart setup uses D3 to render interactive SVG charts. The current index.html file can run the chart without any additional files being loaded. If you'd like to further this project, we have some ideas...  

  - Create a UI for loading data
  - Begin developing formulas to calculate celeration, bounce, verge 
  - Create a daily and a weekly chart
  - Test chart connections to business intelligence software and tools
